A patient shared a worry: "Four days now on Mounjaro. No side effects at the lowest dose. I’m very hopeful, but scared too. I had a heart attack in 2021...

The user expressed hope in reducing cravings in just days while juggling the fear of potential heart-related side effects.

*Takeaway:* Addressing patient fears regarding heart-related side effects while educating on the efficacy and initial effects of Mounjaro might enhance trust and comfort in continued use, especially for patients with pre-existing conditions.
